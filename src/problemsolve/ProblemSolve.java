            String Question="1. Write a program in Java to demonstrate single inheritance, multilevel inheritance and hierarchical \n" +
"inheritance.\n" +
"2. Write a program in Java to develop overloaded constructor. Also develop the copy constructor to \n" +
"create a new object with the state of the existing 0bject.\n" +
"3. Write a program in Java to demonstrate use of this keyword. Check whether this can access the \n" +
"private members of the class or not.\n" +
"4. Write an application that illustrates how to access a hidden variable. Class A declares a static \n" +
"variable x, The class B extends A and declares an instance variable x, display() method in class B \n" +
"dis la s both of these variables.\n" +
"5. Solve the following short codes:\n" +
"a. Write a program in Java to develop user defined exception for 'Divide by Zero' error.\n" +
"b. Write a program in Java to demonstrate multiple try block and multiple catch exception.\n" +
"c. Write a java program using nested try-catch blocks.\n" +
"d. If user enters only one command line argument than inner try block should throw an \n" +
"Exception.\n" +
"e. If user enters two command line arguments, divide first argument by second argument. If \n" +
"second argument is zero than proper exception should be handled.\n" +
"f. Create a simple Java program to create a banking application in which the user deposits \n" +
"BDT 1000 and begins withdrawing BDT 500, BDT 400, and then encounters an exception \n" +
"with the message \"Not Sufficient Fund\" when the user withdraws BDT 300.\n" +
"g. Write a program to handle InterruptedException, IllegalArgumentException using try-catfinally and throw.\n" +
"6. Describe abstract class called Shape which has three subclasses say Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle. \n" +
"Define one method area() in the abstract class and override this area() in these three subclasses to \n" +
"calculate for specific object i.e. area() of Triangle Subclass should calculate area of triangle etc. \n" +
"Same for Rectangle and Circle.\n" +
"7. Write a program that executes two threads. One thread displays \"Threadl\" every 2,000 milliseconds, \n" +
"and the other displays \"Thread2\" every 4,000 milliseconds. Create the threads by extending the \n" +
"Thread class.\n" +
"8. Write a program in Java to demonstrate use of synchronization of threads when multiple threads \n" +
"are t in to u date common variable.\n" +
"9. Write a program that creates an array list, adds a Loan object, a Date Object, a string, and a Circle \n" +
"object to the list. Then, using a loop and the toString() method of each object, show each element \n" +
"in the list";
